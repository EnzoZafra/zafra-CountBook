Counter class

The Counter class is a model class which represents each of the counters in the view.

It implements the Serializable interface so that a Counter object can be passed between Activities
and also be able to save in a local file.

The Counter class has a getter for all of its properties and a setter for all except for the Date
since the Date can never be set from a user input.

The counter has methods to decrement and increment the counter.



ListItemAdapter class

The ListItemAdapter class inherits from the Java class: BaseAdapter and implements the ListAdapter
interface.

The adapter acts as a bridge between a view and the underlying data for that view.
I created a custom adapter as it will create a custom View for each item in the dataset.

It implements the methods from ListAdapter and I overrid the notifyDataSetChanged() method from
BaseAdapter to tell the UI to update the number of counter summary in addition
to calling notifyDataSetChanged()




TextValidator class

This class watches for any changes in a textView and runs a valdator to validate user input.
